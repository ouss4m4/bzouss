description: Every developer should have a blog. specially if you are a beginner.
---

I remember when i first read the [Every developer should have a blog](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/every-developer-should-have-a-blog-heres-why-and-how-to-stick-with-it-5fd55a247fbf/) article on FreeCodeCamp and the idea of creating my own blog sparkled. just like many "in the moment ideas" i thought i did not have the courage nor the time to actually start the blog. Good thing i never stopped learning and pushing forward on my journey.

Today. I realized that it was all in my head. I always had the time to write an article per week or even an article per month. so i decided to create my first blog and start writing articles full of grammar errors and bad syntax. but then it occurred to me that this is actually a good way to work on my english vocabulary. another thing i always wanted to do. and it will not be that bad because i spent the last 2 years reading articles on Medium and Frameworks documentations and it actually improved my writing skills.

I must hit two birds with one stone. i only used [Gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) for a couple of days when it was released. and almost every blog i visited lately was built with Gatsby. so that was one more reason for me to start this blog as soon as possible. i will learn Gatsbyjs along the way.

## Gatsbyjs

I remember reading about the release of GatsbyJS. React was increasing in popularity at the time and whenever a new framework based on React dropped. everyone has to try it. i was still learning React so i built a three page website to test the fresh Framework. and it did not disappoint. Today GatsbyJs Repo has more than 48K ⭐ star on Github.
it is the Static Page Generator of choice ! and much more.

with more than 2000+ plugins available and 489 Starters. I used the marvelous [Gatsby Starter Blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/)
written by Kyle Mathews. it was as simple as writing

    gatsby new bzouss https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog  
and my blog was up and running in no time. took me a minute to figure out how it was all bootstrapped. then i dived a little bit inside the installed packages and i can only say it is amazing to be able to "Create blazing fast websites" in no time.

## Amazon Amplify

Now that i created a blog and pushed it to a github [repository](https://github.com/ouss4m4/bzouss) i need a hosting service. i wanted to use firebase at start but then i realized i have not used Amazon Web Services before. so i created an AWS account and the Free Tier is JUST AMAZING !
AWS offers tons of services but the one that matters for the moment is Amplify !

> AWS Amplify is a set of tools and services that can be used together or on their own, to help front-end web and mobile developers build scalable full stack applications, powered by AWS. With Amplify, you can configure app backends and connect your app in minutes, deploy static web apps in a few clicks, and easily manage app content outside the AWS console.

it was so easy to setup, and with the automatic config detection you only need to connect Amplify to your github account. (they support other git sources) pick a repository. select a branch you would like to build. and in no time you will have your website up and running. and Continuous deploys set up. each time you push to your branch (master usually) it will deploy again automatically.


## Conclusion 

I can only blame myself for delaying this all these years. writing articles is a skill every developer or student should learn. write for yourself. write to help people. write to improve your self esteem.
in this one article i am writing i think i found my new "Cool Off From Coding" trick. it is really relaxing writing about something you love. i have my first GatsbyJS Project added to my github. and now that i discovered how easy it is to setup Amazon Amplify. i will be using it a lot.

so what are you waiting for ? go create your blog right now ! 

* Gatsbyjs
* Amazon Amplify
* Happy Hacking

> Oh it even gets prettier if you decide to use Netlify. i have to use netlify sometime soon !
