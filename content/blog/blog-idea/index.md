description: Every developer should have a blog. specially if you are a beginner.

I remember when i first read the [Every developer should have a blog](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/every-developer-should-have-a-blog-heres-why-and-how-to-stick-with-it-5fd55a247fbf/) article on FreeCodeCamp and the idea of creating my own blog sparkled. just like many "in the moment ideas" i never had the courage or the time to actually start the blog. Good thing i never stopped learning and pushing forward on my journey.

Today. i realized that it was all in my head. i always had the time to write an article per week or even an article per month. so i decided to create my first blog and start writing articles full of grammar errors and bad syntax. but then it occurred to me that this is actually a good way to work on my english vocabulary. another thing i always wanted to do. and it will not be that bad because i spent the last 2 years reading articles on Medium and Frameworks documentations and it actually improved my writing skills.

I must hit two birds with one stone. i only used [Gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) for a couple of days when it was released. and almost every blog i visited lately was written using Gatsby. so that was one more reason for me to start this blog as soon as possible. i will learn Gatsbyjs along the way.

## Gatsbyjs

I remember reading about the release of GatsbyJS. React was increasing in popularity at the time and whenever a new framework based on React dropped. everyone has to try it. i was still learning React so i built a three page website to test the fresh Framework. and it did not disappoint. Today GatsbyJs Repo has more than 48K ‚≠ê star on Github.
it is the Static Page Generator of choice ! and much more.

with more than 2000+ plugins available and 489 Starters. I used the marvelous [Gatsby Starter Blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/)
written by Kyle Mathews. it was as simple as writing  
 `gatsby new bzouss https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog
`  
and my blog was up and running in no time. took me a minute to figure out how it was all bootstrapped. then i dived a little bit inside the installed packages and i can only say it is amazing to be able to " Create blazing fast websites " in no time.
